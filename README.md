This bug demonstrates a common error in Solidity smart contracts: missing events. Events are crucial for monitoring contract state changes and are essential for Dapp front-end interaction. The bug showcases an ownership transfer function without emitting the required OwnershipTransferred event.  The solution shows how to properly emit the event to ensure correct functionality and observability.
